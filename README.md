**Overview**
This project is a pet adoption registration application. It requires the user to enter the pet's information in a specific order and will then release a message declaring the information valid or invalid.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**

Using regex: I have fully understood how to declare the conditions that a regex should check for, for instance using [] to target specific letters and numbers and the $ to represent all the symbols.

Using the test and match function: I know to use the test function to see if something is true or not and match is used to find specifically mentioned conditions.

**Challenges Faced**

There were no technical difficulties in completing this project, the only issue was in learning the content. It was a bit frustrating to understand and remember at first, but with freeCodeCamp practice, I was able to understand the content.

**Areas for Improvement**

I fully understand the content but the common area for improvement is usage. There were many syntax errors in my code that will improve with time and more practice.

**Overall Learning Experience**

This experience was very informative as it was very theory based. I was introduced to JavaScript forms and properties, how to use them and how to use conditions. It was a very fulfilling experience to see the function run and respond to the input values.
